		<about>


Ambuja Cements Ltd. (ACL) is one of the leading cement manufacturing companies in India. The Company, initially called Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd., was founded by Narotam Sekhsaria in 1983 with a partner, Suresh Neotia. Sekhsaria’s business acumen and leadership skills put the company on a fast track to growth. The Company commenced cement production in 1986. The global cement major Holcim acquired management control of ACL in 2006. Holcim today holds little over 50% equity in ACL. The Company is currently known as Ambuja Cements Ltd.
ACL has grown dynamically over the past decade. Its current cement capacity is about 27.25 million tonnes. The Company has five integrated cement manufacturing plants and eight cement grinding units across the country. ACL enjoys a reputation of being one of the most efficient cement manufacturers in the world. Its environment protection measures are on par with the finest in the country. It is one of the most profitable and innovative cement companies in India. ACL is the first Indian cement manufacturers to build a captive port with three terminals along the country’s western coastline to facilitate timely, cost effective and environmentally cleaner shipments of bulk cement to its customers. The Company has its own fleet of ships. ACL has also pioneered the development of the multiple bio-mass co-fired technology for generating greener power in its captive plants.
ACL has always met tough challenges and seized the opportunities that have come its way. It has nurtured the same spirit of enterprise and search for cutting-edge technology with which it started. It thus continues to be the driving force and in many ways a benchmark for the cement industry in India.
